      Kampong Speu, west of Phnom Penh and almost on the capital's doorstep, is
      a province that’s often overlooked, but an ideal place to get off the
      beaten track. Speu is the Khmer word for “starfruit”, but Kampong Speu is
      actually famous for its palm sugar, which is considered the best in the
      Kingdom. The province also produces plenty of teuk t'not chu, or palm
      wine.

      Mount Aoral (Phnom Aoral) is tallest mountain located in this landlocked
      province bordered by Kandal, Koh Kong, Pursat, Kampot, Takeo and Kampong
      Chhnang. It is at 1813 meters above sea level.
