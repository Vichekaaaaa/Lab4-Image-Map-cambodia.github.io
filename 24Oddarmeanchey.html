      Oddar Meanchey, which lies in northwestern Cambodia, is the province where
      the former Khmer Rouge army maintained their last stronghold. The town of
      Anlong Veng, which housed the last home for Pol Pot--the notorious Khmer
      Rouge leader--has been earmarked by the Royal Cambodian Government as one
      of the country's historical sights. The provincial capital is Samraong.

      Though remote, Oddar Meanchey has several historical sites worth visiting.
      In Anlong Veng district, along Road 68, about 100 kilometers east of Oddar
      Meanchey provincial town, is a house once owned by former Khmer Rouge
      Commander Ta Mok. From 1979 until late1997, this area was organized and
      controlled by the Khmer Rouge armies. Some remaining statues describe the
      way the rebels lived and how they arranged their troops during their
      bloody struggle against the government. Additionally, there is a pile of
      tires in the forest that is thought to be the funeral pyre and burial site
      of Pol Pot, the leader of Khmer Rouge. Visitors who stop in Oddar Meanchey
      often make the visit to Anlong Veng to see and photograph the sites
      associated with the former regime. The Cambodian-Thai border check point
      of Ou Smach is about 41km from the provincial town. At the border, there
      are restaurants, casinos and hotels.
