    <p>
      Mondulkiri is about 543km north of Phnom Penh. Despite being the largest
      inland area; Mondulkiri is one of the most sparsely populated provinces in
      the country and can be reached by land or by air. Mondul Kiri is very rich
      in natural resources especially hard minerals such as gold and gems which
      can be found in all five districts of the province.

      Known also for its forested hills and beautiful waterfalls, Mondulkiri is
      one of the most popular destinations for Eco-tourism in Cambodia.
      <br /><br />
      More than 80 percent of the population in Mondul Kiri is made up of tribal
      minorities; the majority of them being from the Phnong tribe. <br /><br />
      Tourists are invited to participate in a wine-sipping tradition that dates
      back since the first visitors from the outside world visited the tribes
      many years ago. The wine is traditionally brewed from rice and stored in
      jars, some of which are more than a thousand years old. <br /><br />
      The remaining 20 percent are collectively made up of Khmer, Chinese, and
      Muslims. Tourists are fascinated by the traditional Phnong houses in which
      there are various types of traditional gongs and big jars which are more
      than a thousand years old. These Jars and gongs are among the most
      valuable possessions of indigenous communities both in traditional and
      spiritual as well as material terms. Get further off the beaten tracks and
      explore the northeastern frontier jungle of Mondulkiri safely on the back
      of an elephant. An elephant ride through lush unspoilt tropical rain
      forest where various large mammals, including dholes, bats, bears, wild
      cattle, buffaloes, deers, elephants, gaurs, gibbons, goats, horses,
      leopards, monkeys, otters, rabbits, tigers and wolves roam, offers one a
      memorable experience promised to last a lifetime. This kind of trekking
      creates jobs for local people and supports eco-tourism and a greener mode
      of transportation.
