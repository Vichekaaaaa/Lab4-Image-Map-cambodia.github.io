      Pailin is a province on the northern edge of the Cardamom Mountains in
      western Cambodia, 25km from the border of Thailand. This province is
      surrounded by Battambang province, and was officially carved out of
      Battambang to become a separate administrative division after the
      surrender of the Khmer Rouge in 1996. A handful of natural attractions are
      await in Pailin, including scenic mountains, waterfalls, and a lush bamboo
      forest. Its capital is Pailin City.

      Another interesting sites for tourists is Wat Rattanak Sorphon, a Burmese
      style pagoda that is more than 570 years old. With beautiful Burmese
      characters are inscribed on the gates, this pagoda is evidence of early
      Burmese settlement in this area. Indeed, the Burmese were the first people
      to discover the precious gems in the region, and Pailin subsequently
      became the largest mining center for sapphires and rubies in Indochina.
      Phnom Yat has a good number of places where visitors can still see the
      gem-mining activities today.
