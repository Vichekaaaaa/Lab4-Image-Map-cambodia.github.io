    <p>
      Takeo province, bordering Vietnam to the south, is blessed with natural
      beauty and many historical sites. Takeo is often recognized as “the cradle
      of the Cambodian civilization,” and contains several significant
      pre-Angkorian sites.

      While heading towards Takeo, make a trip to Phnom Chisor to visit a
      well-preserved 11th century temple from the Angkor era. The temple is
      built on the crest of the hill and surrounded by panoramic views of the
      countryside. The climb up 503 steps to the top may be vigorous, but the
      stunning view of the countryside at the end makes it truly worthwhile.
      This ancient temple is now an active one where Buddhists make pilgrimages
      on religious occasions. There are monks’ quarters and a school. Fine
      carvings of Hindu deities can still be seen on the towers and at the
      libraries, and unique carvings decorate the door of the main temple.

      In Takeo, the Tonle Bati a favourite recreational spot for the locals
      during leisure is a pleasant place to stop by for a standard Khmer meal.
      <br /><br />
      The nearby Tonle Bati Temple is a ‘largely intact’ Angkorian-style temple
      with a picturesque garden. The Yeay Pov Temple, named after King Ta
      Prohm’s mother, is another another historical temple situated near the
      popular Tonle Bati Lake. <br /><br />
      For families, a visit to the Phnom Ta Mao wild life rescue centre is an
      enriching trip. The centre was set up to preserve rescued rare and
      endangered local wildlife. Eighty hectares of the area serves as a zoo for
      visitors.
