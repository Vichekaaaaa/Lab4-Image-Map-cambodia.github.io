      Rattanakiri has long been occupied by many separate highland Khmer Loeu
      hill tribes; some of which has little contact with the rest of the world
      and still maintaining much of their own traditions. Overall, this frontier
      province is renowned for her unique natural beauty and wealth of natural
      resources. The physical and environmental characteristics form an
      impressive range of intriguing destinations for eco-tourism; they include
      undulating hills and mountains, a level plateau, watershed lowlands, clear
      crater lakes, rivers and beautiful waterfalls.

      Today, although rapid development in the province has altered some
      traditional ways of life, this remains a very interesting destination for
      the adventurous and eco-tourism traveller. There are numerous waterfalls
      in this remote region; a few of which are popular picnic locations that
      attract visitors even during the dry season. The idyllic Ou’Sinlair
      waterfall, is one of the popular locations offering wonderful
      opportunities for eco-tourism. The area is covered by the emerald forest
      and surrounding mountains. This waterfall is located in the Lum Phat
      district, just 30km south-west of Banlung. Ka Chanh waterfall, located
      about 7 kilometers southeast of Banlung provincial town, is a 12 meters
      high waterfall fed year round by the O’Kan Teung stream. Its water flows
      into Sre Pok River where bamboo-rafting is a popular tourist activity. The
      waterfall was given its name by the Kreung ethnic minority in Ka Chanh
      village. Ka Tieng waterfall is located 7 kilometers south-west of Banlung
      Town. The waterfall is about 10 meters high; the water is clear and falls
      throughout the year enhancing the beautiful landscape of the area. The Cha
      Ong waterfall, the most visited of the waterfalls around Ban Lung is
      probably so also because of the beautiful undulating landscapes on the way
      to this waterfall. Cha Ong Waterfall is located about 8 kilometres west
      from the center of Banlung. The source of this waterfall is from the Svay
      Mountain where the reclining Buddha at Wat Eisey Patamak is located. The
      waterfall falls over a cave-like pitch where visitors can watch the
      waterfall from behind and enjoy a spray of cool mist caused by the wind.
      Yeak Laom, the Lake featured here, is located about 5 kilo-meters
      southeast of central Banlung. This is basically a volcanic crater formed
      after a volcanic eruption 4,000 years ago; the diameter of the lake is
      about 800 meters and it bears about 50 meters of clear water. At one end,
      there are two wooden platforms for tourists to view the lake up close, but
      some people cannot resist a dip to feel the warmth of the water for
      themselves. A path surrounds the lake, providing a leisurely track for
      trekking; a walk around the lake takes around forty minutes. Midway along
      the track, at the western end of the lake, a small visitor center exhibits
      and sells handicrafts made by the indegenous locals. Visitors can buy
      musical instruments, crossbows, baskets, scarves and handbags made from
      hand-woven cloth. Virachey National Park, one of the most important areas
      for conservation in south east Asia, covers an area of 3,325 km2 and is
      one of two national parks in Cambodia that is protected by the ASEAN
      Heritage Parks organisation. Virachey has one of the more organised
      ecotourism programs in Cambodia, focusing on small-scale culture, nature
      and adventure trekking programs aim to involve and benefit local minority
      communities. Indulge in a thrilling bamboo rafting adventure. Glide along
      the river and into the forest of Virakchey National Park. This is an
      exciting and fulfilling adventures if you have never had bamboo rafting
      experience before
