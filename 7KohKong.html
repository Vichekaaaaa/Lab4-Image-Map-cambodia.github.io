      Located at the southwestern tip of the country near the mouth of the Kah
      Bpow River in Smach Mean Chey district on the Gulf of Thailand, the city
      is only 10 kilometers from the Thai border. From here, tourists now have
      access to the border of Thailand by a newly constructed bridge reputed to
      be the longest in Cambodia. The 1900 meter long Thai-Cambodian
      border-bridge was completed at a cost of US$7.2 million dollars. With the
      bridge and the upgrading of the road to the national highway plus the
      building of several casinos near the border, the town has developed into a
      more popular tourist destination. Besides the casinos, there is a zoo and
      many pristine islands, mountains, jungles, rivers, waterfalls and mangrove
      forest which offer the tourist tons in terms of eco-tourism.
