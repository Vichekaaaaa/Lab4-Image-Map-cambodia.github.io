      Cambodia’s rapid economic growth these past years accelerated urban growth
      in and around the capital Phnom Penh. A modern metropolis dominated by
      skyscrapers and surrounded by satellite cities has morphed from a city
      once dominated by gravel roads, a low-rise and colonial buildings. More
      high-rise buildings are being developed.

      Once hailed, the ’Pearl of Asia’, Phnom Penh is fast regaining its lustre
      having developed to become the nation›s economic, commercial, cultural and
      tourist center. <br /><br />
      Tourists experience a fresh wave of Cambodian hospitality in this city of
      more than 2 million people. Hotels of all levels of comfort and class are
      here in the city to pamper. Cambodians are by nature cordial and friendly.
      Here in the capital city, people are more enterprising; being in the city
      that is now a centre of diverse economic and urban development. The
      riverfront is lined by chic pubs, bistros and boutique hotels. Smart
      little silk boutiques and galleries dot the side streets. A blossoming
      arts scene and a heady dusk-to-dawn nightlife; such are what this pearl
      has now to offer. <br /><br />
      There are much to be enjoyed around Phnom Penh; the list of interesting
      places around the city is a long one. However, even if time permits, a
      ride around the city might be a good place to start. <br /><br />
      There are several fully fletched modern malls in the city that cater to
      just about every convenience including F&B, like those in any big city
      around the world. For a more exotic shopping experience, check out the
      Central market; an Art Deco giant ‘ant-hill’ you wouldn’t want to miss.
      Toul Tom Pong market earns for itself a place in almost every tourist
      magazine for its variety and diversity of ‘Best Buys’ including antiques
      and branded overrun shoes and clothes at huge discounts. Along Sothearos
      Boulevard are some neat ‘antique’ shops that sell silver trays, betel
      boxes, belts, old coins, silver or wooden statuettes and marble carvings;
      good souvenirs. The art galleries on Street 178 near the National Museum
      is also a good place to explore. Top that with a visit to the museum. The
      museum boasts the largest display of Khmer arts in the world; more than
      14,000 with some dating back to the 11th century. The Royal Palace is just
      a strolling distance from the museum. <br /><br />
      The Royal Palace is a complex of beautiful buildings designed in classical
      Khmer style architecture nestled among plots of beautifully manicured
      gardens. The famous ‘Silver Pagoda’ is just next to the palace; both of
      these top tour spots are situated at the river front. Along this stretch
      of road on the land side, check out the shops, eateries and pubs before
      you call it a day. Boat rides can be booked directly at the riverfront.
      Some of these would take you on a romantic night cruise with dinner.
