      Located on the western side of the Tonle Sap lake, Pursat province is
      covered mainly by moutainous terrain. Although the province is not home to
      many ancient temples, the highlight of this province concerns the history
      of the war between Siamese and the Khmers that took place just before the
      French Colonial era in Cambodia. An popular historical site is that of the
      Tomb of Oknha Klang Meung, the Cambodian hero who led the war against
      Siamese and defeated them in 1482.

      While in Pursat, visit the floating town of Kampong Luang, and take in the
      natural beauty of the Ouda. These are unspoiled attractions that this
      charming province boasts. This is also a town known for its top-quality
      marble. Besides farming, most of the residents make their living sculpting
      using marble as the main medium. Kampong Luang, a town floating on the
      Tonle Sap Lake is just 40 km away from the Pursat town center. The
      floating village includes a police station, schools, restaurants, a
      clinic, shops and bars. The town is self-sufficient and is equipped with
      all the facilities of a grounded city. The Ouda, a remote attraction,
      refreshes even the most tired travelers with its gorgeous scenery and
      tranquility. Any stress brought on by the challenges of work or family
      life will be carried away in the natural splendor of the river, which
      flows from the Arai River in the Cardamom Mountains. The mouth of the
      river, approximately 500 meters wide, is framed by thousands of large and
      small rocks. During the rainy season, the crystal clear water crashes over
      the smooth stones, but when the rains dry up, sentimental travelers can
      take a seat on the rocks to reflect on their journey. Opened just a few
      years ago, Ouda is located in Rokat Commune in Kravanh district 58 km from
      Pursat town. Pursat and its surrounding attractions are sure to season
      even the savviest traveler. Lunch along the highway, dip into history with
      Oknha Kleang Mueng, a floating village tour, and a bathe in the healing
      waters of Ouda for an unforgettable trip.
