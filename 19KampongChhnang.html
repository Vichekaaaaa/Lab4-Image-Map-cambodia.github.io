      Kampong Chhnang is a province well known for its fine clay pottery. The
      name of the province says it all in Khmer: Kampong Chhnang means "Port of
      Pottery". The people of this province enjoy making pots, vases and various
      others types of ceramics during the off harvest seasons.

      Interesting sights in the province include two floating villages and a
      hamlet famous for its distinctive pottery. The quiet village of Ondong
      Rossey is where the area's famous red pottery originates. Almost every
      household in this region populated by serene rice fields dotted with sugar
      palms is making some form of pottery or so. The pots, mostly unpainted but
      decorated with etched or appliqu√© designs, are either made with a
      foot-spun wheel (smaller pieces) or banged into shape with a heavy wooden
      spatula (larger ones). The intricate process is fascinating to observe.

      A short boat ride from the waterfront will take travelers to two amazing
      floating villages: Phoum Kandal to the east and Chong Kos to the
      northwest. Many of the village inhabitants there are ethnic Vietnamese.
      Living on the water, they have all the amenities a mainland village would
      have - houses, shops, vendors, petrol station and even a mosque.
