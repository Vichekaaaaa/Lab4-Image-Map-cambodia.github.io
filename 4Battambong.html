      The name Battambang literally means ‘lost staff’; referring to an episode
      in Khmer history when King Dambang Kranhoung threw his wooden staff from
      Angkor and it was said to have landed here in Battambang. This is
      commemorated by a huge black statue with a staff on a ceremonial tray, in
      honour of the staff-throwing king, erected in the center of town.

      Being one of the kingdom’s most populated city, Battambang is set on
      fertile alluvial soil that provides the country’s highest quality rice
      crops. It is known as the Rice Bowl of Cambodia since as a province,
      Battambang can provide sufficient rice to feed the entire country. With
      such agricultural wealth and the existence of both rubies and emeralds
      within the provincial border, Battambang has grown tremendously through
      trade. <br /><br />
      Even with these economic advantages, Battambang still retains its colonial
      charm which is one of the prime reasons many choose to visit the city.
      Surrounding the market are the faded yellow and peeling blue of the
      colonial houses that give Battambang so much of its character.
      <br /><br />
      Places of interest in Battambang include 11th century temples such as the
      Baset Temple, Wat Ek, Prasat Banan and Prasat Snung and the Sek Sak
      natural resort which is a beautiful place any nature loving traveler would
      love to explore. This resort has remained a popular tourist spot for a
      long time. It lies on the banks of a river filled with lots of trees and
      green vegetation making this a scenic paradise. <br /><br />
      Also in this province is Phnom Sampov which is famous its breathtaking
      panoramic sceneries, natural wells and a Buddhist temple. Then there is
      the charming Kamping Puoy Lake, a fabulous lake famous for its giant lotus
      flowers which are used to make an extraordinary fabric through a unique
      process of spinning and weaving the lotus fibers to make a new organic
      fabric.
