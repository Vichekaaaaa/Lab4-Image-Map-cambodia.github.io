      Siem Reap Province is basically the cradle of Angkorean civilization and
      it is a province that offers plenty of opportunity to tourists enthralled
      by the Khmer culture. <br /><br />
      The ruins of Angkor, located amid forests and Farland, are now a UNESCO
      World Heritage Site. There are over one thousand temples ranging in scale
      from nondescript piles of brick rubble scattered through rice fields to
      the magnificent Angkor Wat which is said to be the world’s largest single
      religious monument. There are dozens of temple ruins in the Siem Reap area
      and it depends largely on how much time one has and one’s level of
      interest to determine how long one should spend to explore them.
