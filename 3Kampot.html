      The Bokor National Park is popular for its cool mountain climate and
      remains a year-round favourite amongst locals and foreigners alike. The
      scenery from the top is captivating especially in the morning hours when
      one can literally touch the clouds and take in fresh mountain air. With
      the development of a new resort type 5-star hotel on the summit, the roads
      have all been newly paved.
